# attention-analysis-d2r
A Python project analyzing attention performance using d2-R test data for cognitive research.
# Attention Analysis using d2-R Test

This project demonstrates a basic Python workflow for analyzing attention using simulated d2-R test data. The code computes performance metrics and visualizes concentration scores.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Purpose
The project is intended for demonstrating coding skills in neuropsychological data analysis, particularly focused on attention in the context of behavioral neuroscience and mental health.
